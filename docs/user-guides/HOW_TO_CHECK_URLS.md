## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

### URL Format Issues
- **Missing protocol**: Always include `http://` or `https://`
- **Incomplete URLs**: Ensure the full path is included

- **Ignoring limits**: Be aware of your plan's scanning limits

### Result Interpretation
- **Single provider focus**: Consider all provider results, not just one
