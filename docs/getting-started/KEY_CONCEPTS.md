# Key Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you get the most out of LinkShield's security features. This guide explains the terminology, scoring systems, and core principles behind our platform.

## üîç URL Security Analysis

### What is URL Checking?
URL checking is the process of analyzing a web address (URL) to determine if it's safe to visit. LinkShield examines multiple factors including known threat databases, website reputation, content analysis, and behavioral patterns to assess security risks.

### Scan Types

LinkShield offers three levels of URL analysis, each providing different depths of investigation:

#### Quick Scan
- **Purpose**: Fast security verification for immediate safety decisions
- **Duration**: 5-10 seconds
- **Coverage**: Basic threat detection using primary security databases
- **Providers**: Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal (basic check)
- **Best for**: Suspicious email links, quick safety verification
- **Available to**: All users (including anonymous)

#### Comprehensive Scan
- **Purpose**: Detailed security and reputation analysis
- **Duration**: 15-30 seconds
- **Coverage**: Security threats + domain reputation + content quality
- **Providers**: Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, URLVoid, proprietary analysis
- **Best for**: Business websites, thorough due diligence
- **Available to**: Registered users

#### Deep Scan
- **Purpose**: Complete website analysis including technical health
- **Duration**: 30-60 seconds
- **Coverage**: All security checks + broken links + performance analysis
- **Providers**: All security providers + technical analysis tools
- **Best for**: Website audits, comprehensive security assessment
- **Available to**: Registered users

### Security Providers

LinkShield integrates with multiple security intelligence sources:

- **Google Safe Browsing**: Google's threat detection database

- **URLVoid**: Domain reputation and blacklist checking
- **LinkShield AI**: Proprietary machine learning threat detection
- **Community Reports**: User-submitted threat intelligence

## üìä Risk Assessment

### Risk Score (0-100 Scale)

The risk score is a comprehensive numerical assessment of a URL's safety:

- **0-20**: **SAFE** - Very low risk, generally safe to visit
- **21-50**: **LOW RISK** - Minor concerns, proceed with caution
- **51-70**: **MODERATE RISK** - Significant concerns, avoid if possible
- **71-90**: **HIGH RISK** - Dangerous, strong recommendation to avoid
- **91-100**: **CRITICAL RISK** - Extremely dangerous, do not visit

**How it's calculated:**
- Security provider results (40% weight)
- Domain reputation analysis (25% weight)
- Content quality assessment (20% weight)
- Community reports and feedback (15% weight)

### Threat Levels

#### SAFE üü¢
- **Risk Score**: 0-30
- **Meaning**: No significant threats detected
- **Action**: Safe to visit with normal precautions
- **Examples**: Legitimate business websites, established news sites

#### SUSPICIOUS üü°
- **Risk Score**: 31-70
- **Meaning**: Potential risks or concerning indicators found
- **Action**: Proceed with caution, verify legitimacy
- **Examples**: New domains, sites with mixed reputation signals

#### MALICIOUS üî¥
- **Risk Score**: 71-100
- **Meaning**: Active threats or malicious content detected
- **Action**: Do not visit, report if encountered
- **Examples**: Phishing sites, malware distribution, known scams
