### Interpretation Guidelines

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid URL Format"
- **Cause**: URL doesn't meet format requirements
- **Solution**: Ensure URL includes protocol (http:// or https://)
- **Examples**: 
  - ‚ùå `example.com`
  - ‚úÖ `https://example.com`

#### "URL Not Accessible"
- **Cause**: Website is down or blocks automated scanning
- **Solution**: Try again later or verify URL manually
- **Note**: Some sites block security scanners

#### "Rate Limit Exceeded"
- **Cause**: Too many requests in a short time period
- **Solution**: Wait for the specified retry time or upgrade plan
- **Prevention**: Spread out scanning activities

#### "Scan Timeout"
