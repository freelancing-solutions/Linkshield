  test('should allow a user to analyze a URL and share the public report', async ({ page }) => {
    // Scenario: Complete analysis-to-sharing user flow
    // 1. Input a URL and initiate analysis
    //    - Locate the URL input field and enter a test URL.
    //    - Click the analyze button.
    //    - Wait for navigation to the report page (e.g., /report/[id] or /reports/[slug]).
    //    - Assert that the report page is loaded successfully.

    // 2. Verify the presence of sharing buttons
    //    - Locate the ShareButton and ShareModal components.
    //    - Assert their visibility.

    // 3. Implement privacy setting selection during analysis (if applicable in UI)
    //    - If there's a toggle for public/private during analysis submission, interact with it.
    //    - Assert the initial state of the privacy toggle on the report page.

    // 4. Click the privacy toggle and verify the change
    //    - Locate the privacy Switch component.
    //    - Click the switch to change the report's public/private status.
    //    - Wait for any loading indicators or success toasts.
    //    - Assert that the privacy status is updated (e.g., by re-fetching the report via API or checking UI state).

    // 5. Open the share modal and verify content
    //    - Click the ShareButton to open the ShareModal.
    //    - Assert that the modal is visible.
    //    - Assert that the share URL, title, and description are correctly displayed within the modal.
    //    - (Optional) Assert the presence of social media sharing links.

    // 6. (Optional) Simulate a share action (e.g., copying URL)
    //    - Click the copy URL button within the modal.
    //    - Assert that the URL is copied to the clipboard (Playwright has clipboard access).

    // 7. Verify seamless transition from analysis to sharing
    //    - After analysis, ensure the user is smoothly redirected to the report page
    //      and sharing options are readily available.
  });

  test('should display recent reports in the sidebar and allow navigation', async ({ page }) => {
    // Scenario: Sidebar interaction and navigation
    // 1. Verify the sidebar is visible (or can be opened)
    //    - Locate the sidebar component.
    //    - If it's collapsed by default, click the toggle button to open it.
    //    - Assert that the sidebar is visible.

    // 2. Verify recent reports are displayed
    //    - Assert that the list of recent reports is populated.
    //    - Assert that at least one report item is visible.

    // 3. Click a report in the sidebar and verify navigation to the correct report page
    //    - Locate a specific report item in the sidebar (e.g., by its URL or slug).
    //    - Click the report item.
    //    - Wait for navigation to the corresponding report page.
    //    - Assert that the URL matches the expected report slug.
    //    - Assert that the content of the report page matches the clicked report.
  });

  // TODO: Add more E2E tests for:
  // - Social media sharing integration (e.g., verifying correct share URLs, though actual sharing is hard to test)
  // - Error handling in UI (e.g., invalid URL submission, failed privacy update)
  // - User authentication flows related to sharing (e.g., private report access for logged-in vs. logged-out users)
  // - Responsiveness of the sidebar and report page on different screen sizes.
