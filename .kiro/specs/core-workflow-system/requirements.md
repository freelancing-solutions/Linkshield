# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the core user workflow system that enables URL analysis and report sharing functionality. The system supports both anonymous and authenticated users for URL submission, provides comprehensive report viewing capabilities, and enables report owners to share their analyses publicly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As any user (anonymous or authenticated), I want to submit URLs for analysis, so that I can get insights about website performance and characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a URL submission form
2. WHEN an anonymous user submits a valid URL THEN the system SHALL trigger analysis and redirect to the report page
3. WHEN an authenticated user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a URL submission form
4. WHEN an authenticated user submits a valid URL THEN the system SHALL associate the report with their account and redirect to the report page
5. WHEN any user submits an invalid URL THEN the system SHALL return a validation error and display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed analysis reports, so that I can understand the results of my URL analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a valid report slug URL THEN the system SHALL display the complete analysis details for that report
2. WHEN a report owner views their own report THEN the system SHALL display a "Share" button that is visible and enabled
3. WHEN a non-owner views a report THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "Share" button
4. WHEN a user accesses a non-existent report THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a report owner, I want to share my reports publicly, so that others can view my analysis results without needing an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a report owner clicks the "Share" button THEN the system SHALL open a share modal dialog
2. WHEN a report owner confirms sharing in the modal THEN the system SHALL create a public link for the report
3. WHEN a report is made public THEN the system SHALL update the report's public status in the database
4. WHEN the sharing process completes THEN the system SHALL display the new public URL in the modal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As any user, I want to access publicly shared reports, so that I can view analysis results that have been shared with me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user (including unauthenticated users) navigates to a public report URL THEN the system SHALL display the analysis results
2. WHEN accessing a public report THEN the system SHALL show the same analysis details as the original report
3. WHEN a public report is accessed THEN the system SHALL NOT require authentication or account creation
