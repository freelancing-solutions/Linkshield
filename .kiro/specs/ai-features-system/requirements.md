# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered analysis feature system that provides gated access based on user subscription plans, tracks usage limits, and manages AI analysis processing. The system ensures that AI features are properly restricted to Pro plan users while maintaining accurate usage tracking and database state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Pro plan user, I want access to AI analysis features, so that I can get enhanced insights from my URL analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pro plan user views the URL analysis form THEN the system SHALL display an "Include AI Analysis" option that is visible and enabled
2. WHEN a Pro plan user submits a request with AI analysis enabled THEN the system SHALL process the AI analysis and create an AIAnalysis record
3. WHEN a Pro plan user is within their usage limits THEN the system SHALL allow AI analysis requests
4. IF a Pro plan user successfully requests AI analysis THEN the system SHALL increment their monthly usage counter

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Free plan user, I want clear indication of AI feature restrictions, so that I understand what features require an upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Free plan user views the URL analysis form THEN the system SHALL hide or disable the AI analysis option
2. WHEN a Free plan user attempts to request AI analysis via API THEN the system SHALL return 402 Payment Required or 403 Forbidden error
3. WHEN a Free plan user sees AI features THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate these require a Pro plan upgrade

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want usage tracking and limits enforced, so that AI analysis costs are controlled and users stay within their plan limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully performs AI analysis THEN the system SHALL increment their ai_analyses_used_this_month counter
2. WHEN a user reaches their monthly AI analysis limit THEN the system SHALL block further requests with 429 Too Many Requests error
3. WHEN an AI analysis request fails for non-limit reasons THEN the system SHALL NOT increment the usage counter
4. WHEN a new month begins THEN the system SHALL reset monthly usage counters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper AI analysis database management, so that analysis results are efficiently stored and reused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL create an AIAnalysis record with pending status
2. WHEN an AI analysis already exists for the same content hash THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing analysis instead of creating a new one
3. WHEN AI analysis processing completes THEN the system SHALL update the AIAnalysis record status accordingly
4. WHEN linking analyses to checks THEN the system SHALL properly associate AIAnalysis records with user checks
