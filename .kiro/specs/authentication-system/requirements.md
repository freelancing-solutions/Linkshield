# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive authentication system that provides secure user sign-in, session management, and route protection for the web application. The system will support email-based authentication with JWT sessions and protect both client-side pages and API routes from unauthorized access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my email and password, so that I can access my personalized dashboard and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/auth/signin` THEN the system SHALL display a sign-in form with email input, password input, and sign-in button
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials for an existing account THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to `/dashboard`
3. WHEN a user submits credentials for a non-existent email THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid credentials" error message
4. WHEN a user attempts to submit the form with empty fields THEN the system SHALL prevent submission using HTML5 validation
5. IF a user successfully signs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure JWT session cookie

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure session management, so that user authentication state is properly maintained and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL create a secure, HTTP-only JWT cookie
2. WHEN an authenticated user makes requests THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT session and provide user context
3. WHEN accessing user session data THEN the system SHALL include correct user ID and plan information
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear the session cookie and redirect appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want protected routes, so that unauthorized users cannot access restricted content or functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access `/dashboard` THEN the system SHALL redirect to `/auth/signin`
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user requests protected API endpoints THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized error
3. WHEN an authenticated user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL allow access and provide user context
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear authentication state and redirect to appropriate page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign out of my account, so that I can securely end my session when finished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user clicks the sign-out button THEN the system SHALL clear the session cookie
2. WHEN sign-out is completed THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the homepage or sign-in page
3. WHEN a user attempts to access protected content after sign-out THEN the system SHALL treat them as unauthenticated
