# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Shareable Reports System enhances LinkShield by providing public, shareable report pages with SEO-friendly URLs and a dynamic recent reports sidebar. This feature transforms individual URL analyses into viral marketing tools while providing social proof through a live feed of recent security checks. The system creates shareable URLs like `https://linkshield.site/reports/example-com-abc123` and displays recent reports with color-coded security scores on the homepage.
