# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive payments and subscriptions system integrated with Stripe. The system manages user plan upgrades, subscription lifecycle events, and enforces plan-based feature limits while providing secure payment processing and webhook handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upgrade my plan through a secure payment process, so that I can access premium features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user visits the pricing page THEN the system SHALL display available plans with upgrade buttons
2. WHEN an authenticated user clicks an upgrade button THEN the system SHALL initiate a Stripe checkout session with the correct price ID
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user clicks an upgrade button THEN the system SHALL redirect to the sign-in page
4. WHEN a checkout session is created THEN the system SHALL include the user's ID in the session metadata
5. IF checkout session creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure API endpoints for payment processing, so that unauthorized users cannot initiate payment flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses /api/stripe/checkout THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized error
2. WHEN an authenticated user sends a valid price ID to the checkout endpoint THEN the system SHALL create a Stripe checkout session
3. WHEN the checkout session is created THEN the system SHALL return the session ID to the client
4. WHEN invalid payment data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want webhook processing for subscription events, so that user plans are automatically updated based on payment status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a webhook request has an invalid Stripe signature THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request error
2. WHEN a checkout.session.completed event is received THEN the system SHALL upgrade the user's plan to Pro and set their Stripe customer ID
3. WHEN a customer.subscription.deleted event is received THEN the system SHALL downgrade the user's plan to Free
4. WHEN webhook processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return 200 OK status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want plan limit enforcement, so that users cannot exceed their subscription tier capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Free user exceeds their plan limits THEN the system SHALL return 402 Payment Required or 429 Too Many Requests error
2. WHEN a user upgrades to Pro THEN the system SHALL immediately allow access to Pro features within new limits
3. WHEN plan limits are checked THEN the system SHALL use the most current user plan information from the database
4. WHEN a user's subscription is cancelled THEN the system SHALL enforce Free plan limits on subsequent requests
