I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

LinkShield is a comprehensive security SaaS with multiple interconnected features. The existing documentation focuses heavily on the homepage URL checker component, but lacks comprehensive coverage of:
- Dashboard and project management
- Social protection features
- AI analysis capabilities
- Community reports system
- API keys and developer tools
- Subscription management
- Browser extension integration

The documentation needs to serve multiple audiences: end users, developers, and administrators. I'll create a well-structured skeleton that can be easily expanded with specific content later.


### Approach

I'll create a comprehensive documentation structure for LinkShield that covers all aspects of the SaaS platform. The documentation will be organized into logical sections covering:

1. **Main Documentation Hub** - Central index with navigation to all docs
2. **Getting Started Guide** - Onboarding for new users
3. **Feature Documentation** - Detailed guides for each major feature
4. **User Guides** - Task-oriented how-to guides
5. **Developer Documentation** - API reference, integration guides, SDKs
6. **Architecture & Technical Docs** - System design, security, performance
7. **Subscription & Billing** - Plans, pricing, usage limits
8. **Support & Troubleshooting** - FAQ, common issues, contact info

The documentation will be populated with information gathered from the codebase, spec files, and general knowledge of the platform's functionality. This creates a solid skeleton that can be refined with more specific content later.


### Reasoning

I analyzed the LinkShield codebase structure by listing all directories and files, then read key documentation files including `README.md`, existing docs in the `docs/` folder, and specification files from `.kiro/specs/`. I examined the architecture documentation, requirements for major features (subscriptions, URL analysis, AI analysis, reports), and the package.json to understand the tech stack. This gave me a complete picture of the SaaS platform's features, architecture, and capabilities.
