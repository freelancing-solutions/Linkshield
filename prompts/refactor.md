I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The current in-app documentation structure includes:
- A dynamic route at `/src/app/docs/[[...slug]]/` 
- A layout with sidebar navigation (`DocsSidebar` component)
- Basic placeholder content showing "Documentation coming soon"
- Simple sidebar navigation with Overview, Getting Started, and Integration links

The documentation needs to be completed with comprehensive user-facing content that helps users understand and use all of LinkShield's features effectively.

### Approach

I now understand that this is about the user-facing documentation section within the LinkShield web application (accessible at `/docs`), not the technical documentation for developers. The current implementation shows a basic structure with a sidebar and placeholder content. I'll create a comprehensive specification to complete this user documentation section with content that helps users understand and effectively use LinkShield's features.

The documentation will be organized into logical sections covering all user-facing features, from basic URL analysis to advanced features like AI content analysis, report sharing, and subscription management.

### Reasoning

I explored the application structure and found the in-app documentation section at `/src/app/docs/`. I examined the current implementation including the page component, layout, and sidebar navigation to understand the existing structure that needs to be completed with actual user documentation content.
